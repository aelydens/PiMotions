# Welcome!
## Introduction

We're excited that you are joining us on March 10, 2018 to dive into the wonders of the [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). As you may know, a Raspberry Pi is a tiny, affordable computer we can use to build all kinds of things.

In [Part 1](part1.md) of this workshop, we're going to set up a web application that can take a picture using our Pi with the click of a button.
In [Part 2](part2.md), we will write code to detect motion using the camera connected to the Pi.

To make the workshop run as smoothly as possible, we need you to complete the [prework](prework.md) steps ahead of time.
The If you are unfamiliar with SSH keys, here's a [walkthrough](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key). steps should only take you 10 minutes to complete, and having them done ahead of time will greatly improve your experience.
You won't have to wait for a bunch of things to download over hotel wifi. Do the [prework](prework.md)!

## Overview
We're going to cover a lot of ground in this workshop. :tada:
By the end, you'll have your very own Pi Zero and camera to take home, and you'll know:
